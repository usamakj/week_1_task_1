Basic Semantic HTML5 Page Layout
This project is a simple demonstration of a basic webpage layout created using semantic HTML5 elements. The purpose is to show a best-practice structure for a modern webpage, which is beneficial for accessibility and SEO.

üèõÔ∏è Structure
The layout is composed of the following semantic elements:

<header>: Contains the main heading and a subtitle for the page. It serves as the introductory block for the website.

<nav>: Holds the primary navigation links for the site.

<main>: Acts as the main container for the primary content of the page.

<article>: Represents the main, self-contained content block. This content should be distributable on its own (e.g., as an RSS feed).

<aside>: Contains secondary content, such as related links or a sidebar, that is tangentially related to the main article.

<footer>: Includes closing information, such as copyright details.

üöÄ How to Use
Save the code as an .html file (e.g., index.html).

Open the file directly in any modern web browser to view the layout.

The CSS is included within <style> tags in the <head> for simplicity, but for larger projects, it should be moved to an external stylesheet.

‚ú® Key Features
Semantic Structure: Uses HTML5 tags that describe their own meaning, improving readability for both developers and web browsers.

Accessibility: A clear and logical structure helps screen readers and other assistive technologies navigate the page.

SEO Friendly: Search engines can better understand the content and hierarchy of the page, potentially leading to better rankings.

Basic Styling: Includes minimal internal CSS to visually distinguish the different sections of the page.
